# TODO
- [ ] use the repeat key: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_repeat_key
- [ ] try this https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_advanced_keycodes?id=alt-escape-for-alt-tab
- [ ] macros on the fly by "recording" a keysequence, then executing that using command?
- [ ] switch to https://qmk.github.io/qmk_distro_wsl/
  * compilation without WSL is way too slow
